# COSC-360-Project
---
## Description
TextHub will be a website where users can sign in and engage in online discussion through posts and comments. The website will have several subsections dedicated to certain topics, determined and created by the users. Each subsection is where related posts are made, and under those posts, comments are made. Posts consist of a title and a body. The body may contain text, images, or video, while the title remains strictly text, along with comments. Posts can be upvoted or downvoted and have a net score of upvotes and downvotes, adding to the score and subtracting from it. 

## Design and Styles
We chose a teal blue colour because it is a cool and calming tone and we want our users to feel welcome when using our website. We added the orange as a pop of colour to accentuate certain features such as buttons, sidebars, and text boxes.
